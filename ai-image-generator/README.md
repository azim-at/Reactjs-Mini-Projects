Built using ReactJS for dynamic UI rendering and state management, the app provides a seamless user experience with clean styling via Bootstrap, CSS, and custom components.

User Input: A sleek input field where users can describe what they want to see.

Image Generation: On clicking the "Generate" button, the app sends a request to an AI image generation API (like OpenAI or DeepAI).

Loading State: Displays a custom loading animation while the image is being generated.

Responsive Design: Styled with Bootstrap and custom CSS to ensure a modern, mobile-friendly layout.

Error Handling: Proper alerts and fallbacks are implemented for API errors or invalid responses.
